The One-Click apply feature works well.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.,"Didn't always narrow down my search by geographical location and/or job type correctly.

I used to think there was something scammy about it but through experience, I realized it's probably due to companies who forget to close an open application after hiring is complete.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",I think it's a trusted place to look for a job on the internet. Many recruiting sites have expired postings and really old ones that waste precious time during a job search.

"Dec 21, 2019","I really like the app I was able to send to friends and colleagues making it really easy for them to write a recommendation. When you asking someone to write a letter of recommendation it is invaluable and important for you to have it, but it's an inconvenience for them to be able to take the time to write it. This made it simple and easy for them to use reply to, and as a result I have almost a dozen or so now. I also love the feedback.

The site is easy to navigate and you don't have to add certain information in order to progress through to the next question. Many sites require you to fill in information before you can proceed.

Managing your job posting slots is simple, as well as applying additional paid boosts or enhancements.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","The rejection process/notification to rejected candidates is not as smooth as it could be.  For example, when selecting the ""thumbs down"" icon for an applicant that does not meet your criteria for further consideration, it does not change the applicants status to rejected.  It also does not prompt a rejection email at that time.  It would be best if selecting the thumbs down icon triggered a workflow that accomplished both of those things.

"Nov 29, 2019",I had posted my Resume on several competitor job sites. Zip Recruiter connected me with more employers than the all the other job sites combined!

I like that you can swipe left on jobs to hide them. I like that you can easily apply on a company's website. The search function is good. I've had a few recruiters reach out to me and mention that they saw me on here so that makes me feel like my resume is actually being sent to people or showing up in searches versus like on Indeed where I feel like I'm just sitting out there and I don't get contacted by people from there nearly as much.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.,"For me, it would be nice to save search preferences. Because I don't know if it's because my resume sucks or that I'm super entry level but I don't like how many jobs are for sales positions. I try to swipe right or dismiss as many as I can but I feel like they are VERY common on here versus on Indeed. I guess it makes sense on your guys' end because I'm sure sales companies are always desperate for people so it's not really your guys' fault. It could also be the area that I'm in that there's so many shady pyramid scheme-like ""marketing"" or ""advertising"" agencies.I don't think my issue is really ZipRecruiter's fault but there are so many crappy advertising agencies with misleading headlines & descriptions. I feel like they try to game the algorithm by adding words that someone like me would search for. Like for example, the job title will be ""Marketing Admin Assistant"" and the description will say things like, ""people who have experience with HR, Human Resources, Administrative Assistance, Office Environment, Management,"" etc. just to show up in an HR job search, BUT it will basically be door-to-door sales.

Once a position anywhere is filled the listing should close. There should be some algorithm to make this possible. For example, I once applied to several amount of positions and came to the realization that employers weren't reviewing all the applications coming in. I learned this because I was told at my current job that this outlet is used as a worst-case scenario. So in those terms I was lucky. I also learned this through applying to a certain position to only find out that the business has been closed for months. There needs to be a way to make sure employers are accountable for replying to candidates who are interested in the position.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",ZipRecruiter is helping me become a more detail-oriented individual.

"Nov 16, 2019","What I truly love about ZipRecruiter is that it does what no other job search site does - it allows you to upload your resume and let companies come to you! This is perfect for the person who does not have time to be actively applying constantly, but is interested in new opportunities. I have found that other platforms that claim to do the same simply do not work as well. I get much more contact from recruiters through ZR than anywhere else.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","The only downside of ziprecruiter is that, like many other job platforms, my resume often matches with jobs in the same field as me (healthcare) but they are not jobs I qualify for. This can sometimes be frustrating to have to filter out all of the irrelevant job postings.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","Every job I have ever gotten in the last 3 years has been from ZipRecruiter.

"Jan 28, 2020",Ability to communicate with using the message feature. You can quickly shortlist/discuss candidates by looking at a preview of their resume. You can receive a large volume of good candidates in a very short period of time. We ended up getting over 100 people on the very first dayReview collected by and hosted on G2.com.,"Inability to filter candidates based upon previous/relevant designations. The system takes a lot of ratings to improve suggestions. You can apply location-based filters but there's is no way to candidates from a specific industry or job role. Also, you get limited access to resume database and invite to apply feature is sold separately. I wish they let you send a message or invite people to apply for a job for free.

You have an opportunity to communicate with potential employers without the pressure of meeting and speaking with them for the first time at a formal interview. I like that the site is very user friendly. It gives you opportunity to fine tune your resume to the job posting that you just received. It lets you know how many people have applied for the position through ziprecruiter. It also lets you know when the job is no longer available. One of the best things about the site is the history and status of the jobs that you have applied to. It is an all around good site if you are in need of a job.

However, ZipRecruiter recognized a few key elements on my resume that they suggested might make me a good fit. Fortunately my employer agreed! I also used ZipRecruiter to find my last job. I applied for one position they had listed and then the HR manager at that company called and said ""We have actually decided to do away with the position you originally applied for, but reading your resume...

There are repetitive sales calls and demands for follow-up calls pushing you to purchase more add ons like boosts and bigger ad packages. Now they are changing their service again and have begun charging for the invite to apply. They are making their service even more expensive for people in order actually to attract candidates. To me, they are quickly moving to a point where the value in their basic general ads and resume database is not worth the expense.

"Jul 16, 2019","ZipRecruiter is excellent to get new staff or a job according to your needs, has the feature to complete a profile and upload a resume. But nevertheless, it has some really excellent outstanding features. The suggested and adapted job notifications seem to be really in line with the types of positions that are appropriate based on recent searches or keywords. Too often, job alerts from other job search sites are a bit removed from what the intended search goal is. The function that I like the most is notifications that notify you if your CV has been viewed or if a viewer has given a go. In addition, the metrics that are offered when you see a resume several times are excellent. For example, an alert may say ""Your resume was seen a second time, only 25% of applicants have a second hearing."" I think this helps applicants to maintain a positive outlook and reuse the product. With other job search sites, after sending a resume, you stay in the dark. To make matters worse, this information is available if you use the website or the mobile application ZipRecruiter. I use the Android version of the application, and the ZipRecruiter notifications are notifications that I look forward to.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.","ZipRecruiter offers a fairly complete job search product, and it's my favorite.
